This shows how to print from a TEdgeBrowser (WebView2)
using the newer print settings that are supported since ICoreWebView2_16.

It will work only if the installed version of WebView2 is new enough.

It has been tested on Delphi 11.3 Alexandria.

Programmed by Matthias Bolliger, heavily inspired by [this Microsoft example](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/edge-developer/blob/main/microsoft-edge/webview2/how-to/print.md)
